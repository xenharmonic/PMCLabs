    "This notebook covers generating and visualising sound signals in Python.  It also acts as an introduction to the [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) interactive environment, and to the [Python](http://www.python.org/) programming language and its accompanying libraries.\n",

    "<li>To get help on a function name, just type the name followed by a ?, like sin?</li>\n",
    "<li>You can auto-complete function names by typing the beginning of the function and hitting tab</li>\n",
